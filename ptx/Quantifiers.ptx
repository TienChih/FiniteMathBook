  <title>Quantifiers</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      There are a lot of things in the world.
      A lot of people, a lot of animals, a lot of numbers,
      a lot of toppings available for pizza,
      a lot of things I could add to this list.
      Presumably, sometimes we'd want to make statements about all these things,
      and sometimes we want to make statements about some of these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>x</m> is an MSUB student and <m>I(x)</m> is the statement
      <q><m>x</m> likes ice cream.</q>
      We want to perhaps say something more subtle than this.
      So we introduce the quantifiers <m>\forall</m> and <m>\exists</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <m>\forall</m> is pronounced
      <q>for all</q>
      or
      <q>for every</q>, indicates that the following statement is true for all values of <m>x</m>.
      So <m>\forall I(x)</m> would denote
      <q>For every MSUB student <m>x</m>,
      <m>x</m> likes Ice Cream.</q>. In order for a <m>\forall</m> statement to be true,
      it has to be true for EVERY possible value of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <m>\exists</m> pronounced
      <q>there exists</q>
      or
      <q>there is</q>
      indicates the following statement is true for some values of <m>x</m>.
      It could be true for 1 of them,
      or a bunch of them, or for all of them.
      The only thing we know for sure is that there is AT LEAST 1 value of <m>x</m> for which it is true.
      So <m>\exists I(x)</m> would mean
      <q>There is an MSUB student who likes Ice Cream.</q>
      or
      <q>At least one MSUB student likes Ice Cream.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's let <m>M(x)</m> be
      <q><m>x</m> is a Math Major</q>, <m>C(x)</m> be
      <q><m>x</m> takes Calculus</q>. Then consider the following equivalences:
      <me>
        <tabular>
          <row>
            <cell><term> Logic</term></cell>
            <cell><term> English</term></cell>
          </row>
          <row bottom="minor">
            <cell></cell>
            <cell></cell>
          </row>
          <row>
            <cell>\(\forall (M(x)\to C(x))\)</cell>
            <cell>For every MSUB student, if you're a Math Major then you take Calculus.</cell>
          </row>
          <row>
            <cell>\(\exists (\sim M(x)\wedge \sim C(x))\)</cell>
            <cell>There is an MSUB student who isn't a Math Major and doesn't take Calculus.</cell>
          </row>
          <row>
            <cell>\(\forall \sim C(x)\)</cell>
            <cell>Every MSUB student does not take calculus.</cell>
          </row>
        </tabular>
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting aside whether or not the above statements are actually true,
      here we just see how we can translate statements from english to logical symbols with quantifiers and back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, whenever you see a statement <m>\forall p(x)</m>,
      no matter what <m>p(x)</m> is,
      it is fair to deduce <m>\exists p(x)</m> automatically.
      If somethings true for EVERY <m>x</m>,
      then it also has to be true for at least 1 <m>x</m>.
      The converse is obviously NOT true.
      If something is true for a single <m>x</m>,
      it doesn't mean it will be true for more.
    </p>

    <title>Negating Quantifiers</title>
    <p>
      Let's consider <m>\forall I(x)</m> or
      <q>Every MSUB student likes Ice Cream.</q>
      If this were NOT true, what would that mean?
      It would mean that there is some poor soul out on our campus who does not like Ice Cream.
      In other words: <m>\exists \sim I(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the negation of <m>\exists I(x)</m> be?
      The statement is saying
      <q>There is a student who likes Ice Cream.</q>
      What is the opposite of this?
      It would mean that every single student doesn't like Ice Cream,
      i.e.<nbsp/><m>\forall \sim I(x)</m>.
      So our negation rules are:
      <md>
        <mrow>\sim(\forall p(x))\amp =\amp \exists \sim p(x)</mrow>
        <mrow>\sim(\exists p(x))\amp =\amp \forall \sim p(x)</mrow>
      </md>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's practice on the statements we made earlier:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            The negation of ``For every MSUB student,
            if you're a Math Major then you take Calculus." is:
            <md>
              <mrow>\sim(\forall (M(x)\to C(x)))\amp =\amp \exists\sim (M(x)\to C(x))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp =\amp \exists\sim (\sim M(x)\vee C(x))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp =\amp \exists(M(x)\wedge \sim C(x))</mrow>
            </md>
            ``At MSUB, there is a student who is a Math Major and doesn't take Calculus."
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The negation of ``There is an MSUB student who isn't a Math Major and doesn't take Calculus." is:
            <md>
              <mrow>\sim(\exists (\sim M(x)\wedge \sim C(x)))\amp =\amp \forall \sim(\sim M(x)\wedge \sim C(x))</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp =\amp \forall M(x)\vee C(x)</mrow>
            </md>
            ``Every student at MSUB either is a Math Major or takes Calculus."
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The negation of
            <q>Every MSUB student does not take calculus.</q>
            is:
            <md>
              <mrow>\sim(\forall \sim C(x))\amp =\amp \exists \sim\sim C(x)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp =\amp \exists C(x)</mrow>
            </md>
            <q>There is an MSUB student taking Calculus.</q>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, I'm not claiming any of these things are true IRL. But given the original statements,
      these should read and feel like real opposites.
