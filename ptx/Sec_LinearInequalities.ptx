  <p>
    Remember when we said the solution to something like
    <me>
      2x+3y=12
    </me>
    is the collection of all points <m>(x,y)</m> that make this statement true.
    For equations of the form above, that forms a line.
    If however if we replace the <m>=</m> with an inequality like so:
    <me>
      2x+3y\leq12
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    What we now mean is every pair <m>(x,y)</m> that make THIS statement true.
    So that would include every point on the line <m>2x+3y=12</m>,
    as well as say <m>(0,0), (1,2), (1,3)</m> but not <m>(1,4)</m>
    (plug them in to see why.)
    Obviously, just like in lines,
    we don't want to test every one of infinitely many points to see what's going on.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, we note that <m>2x+3y=12</m> is a line: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/spsryp8xxl}
  </p>
  <p>
    The inequality <m>2x+3y\leq12</m> is not just this line,
    but the entire half of the plane where <m>2x+3y</m> is some value that is less than 12.
    The number 12 cuts the number line in half,
    numbers less than, and greater than 12,
    so it makes sense that this line cuts the <m>x,y</m> plane in half as well,
    we just need to pick a half.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well, we know that <m>2(0)+3(0)=0\leq12</m>,
    and so our half should be the half that contains <m>(0,0)</m>.
    In general, you can pick any point you want and test it.
    For example, if we picked (5,5),
    we would observe that <m>2(5)+3(5)=25\not\leq 12</m> and so we should pick the half that DOESN'T contain <m>(5,5)</m>.
    Either way, we obtain: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yvb1odxncf}
