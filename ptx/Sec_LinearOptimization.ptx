    <statement>
      <p>
        Find <m>(x,y)</m> such that:
        <md>
          <mrow>2x+3y\amp \leq\amp 12</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp \geq\amp 0</mrow>
          <mrow>y\amp \geq\amp 0</mrow>
        </md>
        and <m>f(x,y)=x+y</m> is maximized.
      </p>
      <p>
        From above, we know that this region is a triangle in the first quadrant.
        We want to find the point(s) in this region where by taking the sum of the points,
        we get as large as a value as possible.
        There are infinitely many points in this region,
        how are we ever going to find the one that makes this sum the largest?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, we know that given every possible output from the objective function <m>f</m> i.e.<nbsp/>every possible <m>k</m> so that <m>x+y=k</m>,
        this actually defines a line: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qststwgxro}. In the link you can see the line when <m>k=0</m>.
        There is one point <m>(0,0)</m> which is actually a part of our region which would give this output.
        As we drag <m>k</m> upwards,
        we see that there is a line segment worth of points in our region which would give that <m>k</m> as an output.
        At <m>k=4</m> \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/iy5rq5hpxa} we hit a corner of the region but we see that we can still increase <m>k</m>.
        Now at <m>k=6</m> \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qwrti1mxln}, we see that we've hit another corner.
        Very importantly, if we try to increase <m>k</m> at all,
        our line will fall outside of the feasible region and there will be no points that would give such a <m>k</m> as an output.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, it must be that the largest <m>k</m> can be is 6, and that this happens at <m>(6,0)</m>.
        One can check to see that this point satisfies all the criteria above.
        Most importantly though:
        <term>IT MEANS TO FIND OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS ONE JUST NEEDS TO FIND THE CORNERS OF THE REGION</term>.
        This is because if your line isn't on a corner,
        you can still slide that value up or down,
        so the corresponding <m>k</m> value is neither maximal or minimal.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that a agriculture student is raising goats and pigs for a project.
        The goal is to raise some animals and then sell them for profit.
        She can raise a total of at most 16 animals.
        It costs $25 per goat and $ 75 per pig,
        and she has a budget of $900.
        Finally, she doesn't particularly like goats,
        so she won't raise more than 10 of them.
        If the profit per goat is $12 and profit per pig is $40,
        how many of each should she raise to maximize profits?
      </p>
      <p>
        We should note,
        if <m>x</m> is the number of goats and <m>y</m> the number of pigs,
        then she is maximizing <m>P(x,y)=12x+40y</m>.
        The inequalities she is dealing with are:
        <md>
          <mrow>x+y\amp \leq\amp 16\ \ \text{ at most 16 animals }</mrow>
          <mrow>25x+75y\amp \leq\amp 900\ \ \text{ \dollar900 budget }</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp \leq\amp 10\ \ \text{ hates goats }</mrow>
          <mrow>x\amp \geq\amp 0\ \ \text{ no negative goats }</mrow>
          <mrow>y\amp \geq\amp 0\ \ \text{ no negative pigs }</mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sketching our region out we get: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lwbkvibuyq}, with corner points:
        <me>
          \begin{array}{c|c|c} x \amp  y \amp  P(x,y)\\ \hline 0 \amp  0 \amp  12(0)+40(0)=0\\ 10 \amp  0 \amp  12(10)+40(0)=120\\ 10 \amp  6 \amp  12(10)+40(6)=360\\ 6 \amp  10 \amp  12(6)+40(10)=472\\ 0 \amp  12 \amp  12(0)+40(12)=480 \end{array}
        </me>
      </p>
      <p>
        So the profit is maximized when you raise 12 pigs and no goats.
        To get a better sense of how we found these corners,
        these are just system of <m>2\times 2</m> systems of equations: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bzczxrkggy}
