  <title>Identifying a Linear Function from information.</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      It is often the case that when one works with a linear function,
      one will not be given the exact form for the function.
      You may for example only know the rate of change,
      or the value of the function at a few points.
      To be able to make the most of this situation,
      it would be good to be able to still identify the linear function in question,
      when possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the minimal amount of information necessary to identify a linear function?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is where our geometric interpretation of these functions is helpful.
      If someone handed you a sheet of paper and asked you to draw a line,
      how much information would they have to give you so there could be only one like you'd be able to draw?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is a point enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      If someone drew a dot on a piece of paper,
      there is certainly a line you could draw through it,
      but it definitely does seem like there's infinitely many lines you could draw as well.
      Take <m>(2,3)</m>:

    </p>
    <p>
      Is a slope/direction enough?
    </p>
    <p>
      If someone gave you a piece of paper and told you would direction the line should take,
      there is definitely a line you could draw with that direction,
      but depending where you start,
      there's infinitely many lines you could draw as well.
      Take <m>m=\frac{3}{2}</m>:

    </p>
    <p>
      So this begs the question,
      what <term>IS</term> the mininum amount of information that you'd need to uniquely identify a line?

  <subsection>
    <title>Point &amp; Slope</title>
    <p>
      If we combined the two pieces of information from the start of the section,
      would we obtain a unique line?
      Intuitively this should make sense,
      there are infinitely many lines which go through a point,
      but only one with slope <m>m=\frac{3}{2}</m>, similarly,
      there are infinitely many lines with slope <m>\frac{3}{2}</m>,
      but they all pass through different points,
      only one of them passes through <m>(2,3)</m>.
      Again to refer to our geometric ideas,
      if someone drew a point on a paper,
      and told you which direction you had to go from there,
      there's really only one line you could draw.

    <p>
      How does this translate Algebraically?
    </p>
    <p>
      So given a linear function is defined by the slope <m>m</m> and intercept <m>b</m>.
      By the discussion above,
      if we are given a slope <m>\textcolor{red}{m}</m> and a pair of points <m>\textcolor{blue}{(x_0,y_0)}</m>,
      we should be able to uniquely identify <m>b</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="Example_PandS">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the linear function with slope 3 passing through <m>(2,5)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that we are given <m>\textcolor{red}{m=3}</m> and <m>\textcolor{blue}{(x_0,y_0)=(2,5)}</m>.
          The general form for a line is <m>y=mx+b</m>, thus:
          <md>
            <mrow>y\amp =\amp mx+b</mrow>
            <mrow>\textcolor{blue}{5}\amp =\amp \textcolor{red}{3}\cdot\textcolor{blue}{2}+b</mrow>
            <mrow>5\amp =\amp 6+b</mrow>
            <mrow>b\amp =\amp 5-6=-1</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus <m>y=3x-1</m> is the linear equation in question,
          <m>m=3, b=-1</m>.

          We can verify that this line has slope <m>m=3</m> and when <m>x=2, y=3\cdot 2-1=6-1=5</m>.

      </statement>

  <subsection>
    <title>Point-Slope form.</title>
    <p>
      So, typically lines are defined in the form <m>y=mx+b</m>,
      where <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>b</m> is the <m>y</m>-intercept.
      It can be convenient to also define a line in the form
      <me>
        y-y_0=m(x-x_0)
      </me>,
      where <m>(x_0, y_0)</m> is a point that falls on your line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why would we care about a second formulation,
      and how do we know it's even a line?
      To answer the first question,
      we recall that ANY geometric object defined by an equation is the set of points that make the equation true.
      So given the equation <m>y-y_0=m(x-x_0)</m>,
      if we plug in <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>,
      we would get <m>y_0-y_0=m(x_0-x_0)</m> or <m>0=0</m> which is definitely a true statement.
      So whatever shape we get from <m>y-y_0=m(x-x_0)</m>,
      it contains <m>(x_0, y_0)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know it's a line because:
      <md>
        <mrow>y-y_0\amp =\amp m(x-x_0)</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =\amp mx-mx_0+y_0</mrow>
        <mrow>y\amp =\amp mx+(y_0-mx_0)</mrow>
      </md>
      so if we let <m>b=y_0-mx_0</m>,
      we get the standard form for a line.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="Example_PandSagain">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the line with slope 3 passing through <m>(2,5)</m>, again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using the point-slope form,
          knowing that <m>\textcolor{blue}{(2,5)}</m> lies on the line,
          and that <m>\textcolor{red}{m}</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>y-y_0\amp =\amp m(x-x_0)</mrow>
            <mrow>y-\textcolor{blue}{5}\amp =\amp \textcolor{red}{3}(x-\textcolor{blue}{2})</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =\amp 3x-6+5</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =\amp 3x-1</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either way, you obtain the same line,
          with slope 3, passing through (2,5).
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

  <subsection>
    <title>Two Points</title>
    <p>
      On the other hand, instead of giving you a point and a direction,
      one could be given two points to traverse through.
      If you imagine any two dots on a piece of paper,
      one can imagine that you may draw a line between them.
      The exact way we do this also follows intuitively.
      If you were at home, and you had to go to the store,
      the natural steps you would take to do so are:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Figure out which way to the store.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Go there.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have to figure out the direction between these points,
      which in our analogy means the slope between the points.
      Remember the slope measures how much <m>y</m> changes per change in <m>x</m>,
      or <m>m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}</m>.
      So, the measurement of slope follows from the change in <m>y</m> over the change in <m>x</m>.
      So to measure this, if we have points <m>(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1)</m>,
      we want to see how much <m>y</m> changes over how much <m>x</m> changes, or:
      <me>
        m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0}
      </me>
      or equivalently <m>m=\frac{y_0-y_1}{x_0-x_1}</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="Example_PandP">
      <statement>
        <p>
          What line passes between <m>(2,3)</m> and <m>(4,1)</m>?
        </p>
        <p>
          So we note then that <m>\textcolor{red}{m=\frac{1-3}{4-2}=-1}</m>
          (also <m>\textcolor{red}{m=\frac{3-1}{2-4}=-1}</m>).
          Once the slope is identified,
          we can use any point, and any method to find the line.
          Once we pick a point, We have a problem that follows the form of <xref ref="Example_PandS">Examples</xref>,
          <xref ref="Example_PandSagain"></xref>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We won't go through all the possibilities but if we considered the point <m>\textcolor{blue}{(2,3)}</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>y\amp =\amp mx+b</mrow>
            <mrow>\textcolor{blue}{3}\amp =\amp \textcolor{red}{-1}\cdot \textcolor{blue}{2}+b</mrow>
            <mrow>b\amp =\amp 3+2=5</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =\amp -x+5</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or if we picked <m>\textcolor{blue}{(1,4)}</m>:
          <md>
            <mrow>y-y_0\amp =\amp m(x-x_0)</mrow>
            <mrow>y-\textcolor{blue}{1}\amp =\amp \textcolor{red}{-1}\cdot(x-\textcolor{blue}{4})</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =\amp -x+4+1</mrow>
            <mrow>y\amp =\amp -x+5</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either way, we identify the same line:
