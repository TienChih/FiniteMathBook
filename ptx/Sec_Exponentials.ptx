        An <term>exponential function</term>
        is a function <m>f(x)</m> which may be written as <m>f(x)=b\cdot a^x</m>.

    We should note that we've seen exponential functions before,
    in the guise of compound interest.
    If the future value of a debt is
    <m>S=P(1+i)^x</m> after <m>x</m> unites of time,
    then <m>P</m> is your <m>b</m> and <m>1+i</m> is your <m>a</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We should also note that there is a real kinship between exponential functions and linear functions.
    Linear functions have the form <m>\ell(x)=mx+b</m>,
    which we can think of as <m>\ell(x)=\overbrace{m+m+\cdots+m}^x+b</m>,
    with <m>x</m> copies of <m>m</m>.
    Similarly we can see that <m>f(x)=b\cdot a^x=\overbrace{a\cdot a\cdots a}^x\cdot b</m>,
    so it is really the multiplicative analogue of the linear function,
    where the <m>b</m>'s are the initial value of the function when <m>x=0</m> and the growth rate of the function is totally determined by <m>a</m>
    (whereas it's determined by <m>m</m> for linear functions).
  </p>
  <p>
    In that way, we can also tell when
    <m>f(x)=b\cdot a^x</m> is increasing or decreasing,
    just by looking at whether or not <m>a>1</m> or <m>a\lt 1</m>.
    If <m>a>1</m> it is increasing: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/edktzphc6x} if <m>a\lt 1</m> then it's decreasing: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rpiu9qc4ty}.

    Exponential functions are used to model anything that grows or decays proportionately to it's current value.
    So for example debts or investment accrue proportionately to how much debt/investment there already is.
    Population is another example,
    the greater the population,
    the more reproduction there will be within that population and the greater the increase in population.
