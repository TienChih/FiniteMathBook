  <p>
    Consider
    <me>
      \begin{circuitikz}  \draw (0,0) to[ospst=$p$] (2,0);  \end{circuitikz}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the diagram of the
    <q>circuit</q>
    <m>p</m> Imagine <m>T</m> as been the bridge open and <m>F</m> as the bridge closed.
    Can you cross over, well,
    yes as long as the bridge is open,
    i.e. as long as <m>p</m> is true.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now how about this:
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider
    <me>
      \begin{circuitikz}  \draw (0,0) to[ospst=$p$] (2,0);  \draw (2,0) to[ospst=$q$] (4,0);  \end{circuitikz}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Can you get to the other side?
    Well, as long as both bridges are open, i.e.
    <m>p\wedge q</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    How about this?
    <me>
      \begin{circuitikz}  \draw (0,0) to (2,0); \draw (2,0) to (2,1); \draw (2,0) to (2,-1);  \draw (2,1) to[ospst=$p$] (4,1);  \draw (2,-1) to[ospst=$q$] (4,-1);  \draw(4,1) to (4,0); \draw(4,-1) to (4,0);  \draw(4,0) to (6,0);   \end{circuitikz}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Can you get from one side to the other?
    Yes, as long as either bridge is open we can,
    so this is <m>p\vee q</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using these circuit diagrams,
    we can model any logical statement.
    For example <m>p\wedge ((q\wedge r) \vee (\sim q \wedge \sim r))</m> would be:
    <me>
      \begin{circuitikz}  \draw (0,0) to[ospst=$p$] (2,0); \draw (2,0) to (2,1); \draw (2,0) to (2,-1);  \draw (2,1) to[ospst=$q$] (3,1); \draw (3,1) to[ospst=$r$] (4,1);  \draw (2,-1) to[ospst=$\sim q$] (3,-1); \draw (3,-1) to[ospst=$\sim r$] (4,-1);  \draw(4,1) to (4,0); \draw(4,-1) to (4,0);  \draw(4,0) to (5,0);   \end{circuitikz}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    And
    <me>
      \begin{circuitikz}  \draw (0,0) to[ospst=$p$] (2,0); \draw (2,0) to (2,1); \draw (2,0) to (2,-1);  \draw (2,1) to[ospst=$q$] (3,1); \draw (3,1) to[ospst=$r$] (4,1);  \draw (2,-1) to (3,-1); \draw (3,-1) to (3,-.5); \draw (3,-1) to (3,-1.5);  \draw (3,-.5) to[ospst=$\sim s$] (4,-.5); \draw (3,-1.5) to[ospst=$\sim t$] (4,-1.5);      \draw(4,1) to (4,0); \draw(4,-1.5) to (4,0);  \draw(4,0) to (5,0);   \end{circuitikz}
    </me>
    would be <m>p \wedge ((q\wedge r)\vee (\sim s\vee \sim t))</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here, it again helps to be able to break everything down into ands/ors.
    We don't have something for implications,
    but of we wanted to do the circuit for <m>\sim((p\vee q)\to r)</m>,
    we could note:
    <md>
      <mrow>\sim((p\vee q)\to r)\amp =\amp \sim(\sim(p\vee q)\vee r)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\amp (p\vee q)\wedge \sim r</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So it's circuit would be:
    <me>
      \begin{circuitikz}  \draw (0,0) to (2,0); \draw (2,0) to (2,1); \draw (2,0) to (2,-1);  \draw (2,1) to[ospst=$p$] (4,1);  \draw (2,-1) to[ospst=$q$] (4,-1);  \draw(4,1) to (4,0); \draw(4,-1) to (4,0);  \draw(4,0) to[ospst=$\sim r$] (6,0);   \end{circuitikz}
    </me>
