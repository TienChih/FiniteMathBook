  <title>The Derivative as a Limit</title>
  <p>
    Let's be a bit more general for just a moment,
    suppose that we had a function <m>f(x)</m> and we wanted to know what the instantaneous rate of change of a function was at some given <m>x</m>.
    Well, if we stepped forward by <m>h</m> units,
    we could measure the average rate of change of <m>f(x)</m> over <m>[x, x+h]</m>,
    this would be
    <me>
      \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x}=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    What we just observed is that if we let <m>h</m> converge towards 0, that it seems as if our quotient also converges to some value.
    This value is the derivative of <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x</m> and is denoted and defined as
    <me>
      f'(x)=\limit{h}{0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So how does this play out given our rocket?
    Well:
    <md>
      <mrow>f'(x)\amp =\amp \limit{h}{0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\amp \limit{h}{0} \frac{-5(x+h)^2+20(x+h)-(-5x^2+20x)}{h}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\amp \limit{h}{0}\frac{-5x^2-10xh-5h^2+20x+20h+5x^2-20x}{h}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\amp \limit{h}{0}\frac{-10xh-5h^2+20h}{h}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\amp \limit{h}{0}\frac{(-10x-5h+20)h}{h}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\amp \limit{h}{0} -10x-5h+20</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp =\amp -10x+20</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So this means that in <m>0</m> seconds,
    the change in the height was
    <m>f'(0)=-10(0)+20=20</m> meters/second as we suspected!
    But now we can compute all the other instantaneous rates of change as well.
    So at <m>t=1</m> second,
    it'll be <m>f'(1)=-10(1)+20=10</m> meters per second.
    In 2 seconds we are at the top with <m>f'(2)=0</m> meters per second,
    at 3 seconds,
    <m>f'(3)=-10</m> meters/second to reflect the negative change in height at this point.
    Finally in 4 seconds, the rocket hits the ground at
    <m>f'(4)=-20</m> meters per second. (drag <m>a</m> around and see for yourself! \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/3po0qezgel})
