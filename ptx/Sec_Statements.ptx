    Something thats often misunderstood about Math is that people think that Math is the study of numbers.
    This is false, and not even historically justifiable.
    Certainly numeracy has taken on a great role within mathematics,
    but that is not fundamentally what the discipline is.
    Really, even when Math deals with numbers,
    the fundamental thing that is studied are not numbers but <term>statements</term>.
    What is a statement?
    It is a sentence that is true or false, but not both.
    For example:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          MSU-Billings is a State School.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>10+5=12</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>x\lt 4</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The first sentence is a true sentence,
    the second sentence is a false sentence.
    The third is true or false depending on the value of <m>x</m>,
    but at no point can it take on the value of both true and false.
  </p>
  <p>
    So we're going to be doing something in this chapter that seems fairly strange.
    We are going to be working with variables that are placeholders for statements rather than numbers.
    The possible values for these statements then, are
    <q>True</q>
    and
    <q>False</q>. We will be performing operations on these statements as in standard algebra,
    but since every variable has only 2 possible values,
    the rules of our algebra are going to be different.
