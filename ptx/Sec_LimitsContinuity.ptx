  <title>Limits &amp; Continuity</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Informally, the limit of a function <m>\limit{x}{a} f(x)=L</m>
      (if it exists)
      is a number <m>L</m> such that when <m>f(x)</m> get's closer and closer to <m>a</m>,
      <m>f(x)</m> gets closer and closer to <m>L</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider the function <m>f(x)=\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}</m>,
      what happens as <m>x</m> get's closer and closer to 1?
      <me>
        \begin{array}{|c|c|} \hline x \amp  f(x)\\ \hline 1.1 \amp  2.1\\ 1.01 \amp  2.01\\ 1.001 \amp  2.001\\ .9 \amp  1.9\\ .99\amp 1.99\\ .999 \amp  1.999\\ \hline \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can test and see these values here: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w3ycpf3mv4}. It certainly seems as if <m>x</m> gets closer and closer to <m>1</m>,
      <m>f(x)</m> approaches the value <m>2</m>.
      Why couldn't we just plug in 1?
      Because if we did we would get <m>f(1)``=''\frac{1^2-1}{1-1}``=''\frac{0}{0}</m> which is undefined.
      Recall that <m>1</m> would not be a part of the domain of <m>f(x)</m>.
      This, in fact, is the whole point of limits,
      the entire reason they exist,
      is in order to give values to things like <m>f(1)</m> which are not defined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The left and right limits of a function are values the function approaches as <m>x</m> <m>a</m> from the left or the right,
      so as we see above, they both
      (the black and orange dots in the linked graph)
      both approach the same value.
      So:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{1^-}\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=2</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{1^+}\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=2</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{1}\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=2</m>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(1)</m> is undefined.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      So looking at this graph:

    <p>
      For <m>x=2,4,6,8</m>, find the left and right limits,
      the limit, and the value of the function.
      See if you understand why the following are true:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{2^-}f(x)=2</m>,
            as we approach <m>x</m> from the left,
            this is what <m>f(x)</m> approaches.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{2^+}f(x)=1</m>,
            as we approach <m>x</m> from the right,
            this is what <m>f(x)</m> approaches.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{2}f(x)</m> is undefined,
            there is no single number that <m>f(x)</m> get's closer to,
            so there is no limit.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(2)=1</m>, that's the actual value of <m>f(2)</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, we should see:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{4^-}f(x)=1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{4^+}f(x)=1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{4}f(x)=1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(4)=-1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{6^-}f(x)=-1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{6^+}f(x)=-1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{6}f(x)=-1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(6)=-1</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{8^-}f(x)=-3</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{8^+}f(x)=-3</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>\limit{x}{8}f(x)=-3</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>f(8)</m> is undefined.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      A great shorthand for determining when there is or isn't a limit is: ``<m>\limit{x}{a}f(x)=L</m> and exists if and only if
      <m>\limit{x}{a^-}f(x)=L</m> and <m>\limit{x}{a^+}f(x)=L</m>"

    <title>Continuity</title>
    <p>
      I'm not going to overblow continuity with to much verbiage here since we intuitive understand what it means to be continuous,
      it just means that all the points
      <q>connect</q>. So what does tat mean for us above?
      Out of the values <m>x=2,4,6,8</m>,
      where is <m>x</m> continuous?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems like it's only 6 where it's continuous. 2 and 4 have jump discontinuities,
      and <m>f(x)</m> isn't even defined at <m>x=8</m> so how could it be continuous there?
      So the definition of continuous is as intuitive as we would like:
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>f(x)</m> is continuous at <m>a</m> if and only of <m>f(a)=\limit{x}{a} f(x)</m>.
      So as in above, out of the 4 points we looked at,
      <m>x=6</m> is the only place where everything
      <q>behaves properly</q>
      and we get continuity.
