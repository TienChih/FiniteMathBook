    <title>Form of Quadratic functions</title>
    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>q(x)</m> is a <term> quadratic function</term> if it may be written as:
          <me>
            q(x)=ax^2+bx+c
          </me>.
          where <m>a\neq0</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <p>
      The classic example is the standard parabola,
      <m>y=x^2</m> or a quadratic with
      <m>a=1. b,c=0</m>. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/aktz8g8cbh}. We should be familiar with some of the properties of this shape,
      it's symmetric on both sides and it goes to positive infinity in both directions
      (as <m>x^2</m> cannot be negative).
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be nice if we could show that all quadratics had the same essential shape.
      To do this, we must first show that all quadratics also have the form
      <me>
        q(x)=a(x-h)^2+k
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see this:
      <md>
        <mrow>q(x)\amp =\amp ax^2+bx+c</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\amp a(x^2+\frac{b}{a}x)+c</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\amp a(x^2+2\frac{b}{2a}x+\frac{b^2}{4a^2})+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp =\amp a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      So by letting <m>h=-\frac{b}{2a}</m> and <m>k=c-\frac{b^2}{4a}</m>,
      we have our form.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting byproduct of this is that if we were to solve <m>ax^2+bx+c=0</m>,
      we would get:
      <md>
        <mrow>ax^2+bx+c\amp =\amp 0</mrow>
        <mrow>a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2+c-\frac{b^2}{4a}\amp =\amp 0</mrow>
        <mrow>a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2=\frac{b^2}{4a}-c</mrow>
        <mrow>a(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a}</mrow>
        <mrow>(x+\frac{b}{2a})^2=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}</mrow>
        <mrow>x+\frac{b}{2a}=\frac{\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
        <mrow>x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</mrow>
      </md>
    </p>
    <p>
      Which is the quadratic formula.

    <p>
      Now that we have this form
      <m>a(x-h)^2+k</m>, consider how <m>a,h</m>,
      and <m>k</m> affect the shape of the graph: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/4zqd9chlna}.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sliding <m>k</m> shifts the parabola up and down.
      We can think of this as adding to or detracting from the value of <m>x^2</m>.
      Sliding <m>h</m> shifts the graph left and right.
      We can think of this as slowing down or speeding up <m>x^2</m> by <m>h</m> units.
      <m>a</m> stretches or squashes <m>x^2</m>,
      or if <m>a</m> is negative, also reflects this across the <m>x</m> axis.
      But all of these transformations preserve the fundamental shape of a parabola,
      so all quadratic functions have this shape.
