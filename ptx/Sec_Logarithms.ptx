    So looking at any exponential function,
    but specifically for increasing ones,
    we notice that they are 1-1, meaning two different inputs give you 2 different outputs.
    Thus, <m>f(x)=a^x</m> is an invertible function.
    You can see in these graphs \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/cvriy608bg} that reflecting the exponential over the <m>y=x</m> line giving us the green function is another function.
    We call this function <m>\log_a(x)</m>.
    As the inverse of an exponential function, it has some properties:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>It's domain is only positive numbers</term>.
          Why?
          Because the only possible outputs of exponential outputs are positive numbers.
          Taking the inverse reverses the roles of the domain and range,
          and so the domain of <m>\log_a</m> is the positives.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <term>As <m>\mathbf{x}</m> goes to 0,
          <m>\mathbf{\log_a(x)}</m> goes to <m>\mathbf{-\infty}</m>.</term>
          This is the result of the reflection.
          Normally <m>a^x</m>
          (for <m>a>1</m>)
          goes to 0 as <m>x\to -\infty</m>,
          so when reflected, that line is now asymptotic to the <m>y</m>-axis.
          Also <m>\log_a</m> returns the power necessary to achieve the value <m>x</m>.
          If <m>x</m> is a small number like 0.0001,
          what power would I have to raise <m>a</m> to to get <m>0.0001</m>?
          It can't be 0, <m>a^0=1</m>,
          so it has to be <term>less</term>
          than 0, and the smaller <m>x</m> is,
          the lower this power must go.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          As <m>\mathbf{x\to\infty, \log_a(x)\to \infty}</m>,
          again this is the result of the reflection,
          but we can also think of this as the powers <m>a</m> needs to be raised to in order to achieve <m>x</m>,
          as this increases, those powers must increase as well.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\log_a(xy)=\log_a(x)+\log_a(y)</m>.
          Too see this consider:
          <md>
            <mrow>xy\amp =\amp a^{\log_a{xy}}</mrow>
            <mrow>xy\amp =\amp x\cdot y</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\amp a^{\log_a(x)}\cdot a^{\log_a(y)}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\amp a^{\log_a(x)+\log_a(y)}</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>\log_a(x^y)=y\log_a(x)</m>.
          To see this, consider:
          <md>
            <mrow>x^y\amp =\amp a^{\log_a(x^y)}.</mrow>
            <mrow>x^y\amp =\amp (a^{\log_a(x)})^y</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\amp a^{y\log_a(x)}</mrow>
          </md>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Typically most textbooks include a whole bunch of other arithmetic rules,
    but they can all be distilled from the 2 above so they're all totally pointless.
  </p>
  <p>
    Special cases of logs are log base 10 which is usually just denoted <m>\log</m> and log based <m>e</m>,
    which is denoted <m>\ln</m>.
    Astronomers and other scientists like <m>\log</m> since taking <m>\log</m> base 10 gives you approximate magnitude of stuff.
    As a mathematician, I prefer <m>\ln</m> since <m>e</m> has pretty special mathematical properties,
    plus it's shorter, which makes it better.
  </p>
  <p>
    The main use of logs algebraically is to de-exponentiate expressions.
    So if one is trying to solve <m>10=2^x</m>, we could do this via:
    <md>
      <mrow>10\amp =\amp 2^x</mrow>
      <mrow>\ln(10)\amp =\amp \ln(2^x)</mrow>
      <mrow>\ln(10)\amp =\amp x\ln(2)</mrow>
      <mrow>x\amp =\amp \frac{\ln(10)}{\ln(2)}\approx 3.3219</mrow>
    </md>.

    One can also solve problems like this visually: \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/t0pojr0gel}.
