  <title>Average rates of change</title>
  <p>
    Consider a rocket that is launched into the air and has height
    <m>f(x)=-5x^2+20x</m> meters in <m>x</m> seconds. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1rwsdsbcm9}. How fast is the rocket traveling when it's launched (<m>x=0</m> seconds)?
  </p>
  <p>
    Turns out, it's not so easy to think about what this is,
    we don't typically think about speeds in terms of instantaneous action.
    Our methods of measuring speed reflects this,
    it's always stuff like meters <term> PER SECOND</term>,
    miles <term> PER HOUR</term>,
    in other words speed is some change in distance <term> OVER TIME</term>
    and that period of time is not typically 0.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what now?
    Lets start by asking an easier question,
    what is the average speed of the rocket over the first 3 seconds?
  </p>
  <p>
    It's best in a scenario like this to NOT overthink the underlying problem.
    At 0 seconds,
    you're <m>f(0)=-5(0)^2+20(0)=0</m> meters off the ground.
    After 3 seconds you are <m>f(3)=-5(3^2)+20(3)=15</m> meters off the ground.
    So you rose by 15 meters in 3 seconds?
    You're aveerage speed must be 5 meters per second. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6k61owwnrd}.

  <p>
    In fact: <term> The average rate of change of a function <m>f(x)</m> over the interval <m>[a,b]</m> is <m>m=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}</m>.</term>
    This is just the slope of the line connecting <m>(a,f(a))</m> and <m>(b,f(b))</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following this idea,
    the average velocity of our rocket over the 1st 2 seconds is:
    <m>m=\frac{f(2)-f(0)}{2-0}=\frac{20}{2}=10</m> meters per second. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ihauynuflo}
  </p>
  <p>
    The average velocity of our rocket over the 1st second is:
    <m>m=\frac{f(1)-f(0)}{1-0}=\frac{15}{1}=15</m> meters per second. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/jce0fd1bsr}
  </p>
  <p>
    The average velocity of our rocket over the 1st half second is:
    <m>m=\frac{f(.5)-f(0)}{.5-0}=\frac{8.75}{.5}=17.5</m> meters per second. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xpxlltf8f5}
  </p>
  <p>
    The average velocity of our rocket over the 1st quarter second is:
    <m>m=\frac{f(.25)-f(0)}{.25-0}=\frac{4.6875}{.25}=18.75</m> meters per second. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/74kpvz17c5}
  </p>
  <p>
    The average velocity of our rocket over the 1st tenth of a second is:
    <m>m=\frac{f(.1)-f(0)}{.1-0}=\frac{1.95}{.1}=19.5</m> meters per second. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qyvtzmyg8k}
  </p>
  <p>
    The average velocity of our rocket over the 1st hundreth of a second is:
    <m>m=\frac{f(.01)-f(0)}{.01-0}=\frac{.1995}{.1}=19.95</m> meters per second. \url{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hrawtifwdw}
  </p>
  <p>
    And it does seem like these numbers are getting closer and closer to 20 meters per second as <m>b</m> gets closer to 0.
    But if I plug in <m>0</m> for <m>b</m>, I get an undefined <m>0/0</m> fraction.
    Oh, if only there were some concept in mathematics to describe the values of a function as your inputs slowly approach a given value.........
