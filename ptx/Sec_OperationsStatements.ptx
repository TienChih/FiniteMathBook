  <title>Operations on Statements</title>
  <subsection>
    <title>Not</title>
    <p>
      The first sort of operation we can perform is <term>negation</term>.
      Given any statement,
      the negation is a statement that is false whenever the original statement is true,
      and true when the original is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example if <m>p=\text{ ``It will rain today'' }</m>,
      then it's negation <m>\sim p=\text{ ``it will not rain today'' }</m>,
      similarly if <m>q=``x>10''</m>,
      then it's negation <m>\sim q =``x\leq 10''</m>.
      These are statements that are true whenever the original statement is false and false when they are true.
    </p>
    <p>
      A convenient way to record when a statement is true or false is by something called a
      <q>truth table</q>. By listing all the truth values of <m>p</m>,
      we can see when <m>\sim p</m> is true:
      <me>
        \begin{array}{c|c} p\amp \sim p\\ \hline T \amp  F\\ F\amp T \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>And</title>
    <p>
      Given statements <m>p</m>, <m>q</m>,
      the statement <m>p\wedge q</m> pronounced <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> is when <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> are both true,
      otherwise it is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if <m>p=</m>
      <q>I will eat breakfast today</q>
      and <m>q=</m>
      <q>I will eat lunch today</q>, then the statement <m>p\wedge q</m> is the statement
      <q>I will breakfast today and I will eat lunch today</q>
      which is only true if you eat both meals,
      if you skip one or both, then it is false.
      <me>
        \begin{array}{c|c|c} p\amp q\amp p\wedge q\\ \hline T \amp  T\amp T\\ T\amp F\amp F\\ F\amp T\amp F\\ F\amp F\amp F \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you skipped breakfast but had lunch,
      you could take a look at the third line and see that the compound statement
      <q>I will breakfast today and I will eat lunch today</q>
      is false.
    </p>
  </subsection>
  <subsection>
    <title>Or</title>
    <p>
      Given statements <m>p</m>, <m>q</m>,
      the statement <m>p\vee q</m> pronounced <m>p</m> or <m>q</m> is when either <m>p</m> or <m>q</m> is true,
      otherwise it is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      So as in the above example,
      <m>p\vee q</m> would be ``I will eat breakfast today or I will eat lunch today" and you're covered as long as you either have breakfast or lunch.
      If you skip both, then you're lying,
      but as long as you had either you're telling the truth.
      <me>
        \begin{array}{c|c|c} p\amp q\amp p\vee q\\ \hline T \amp  T\amp T\\ T\amp F\amp T\\ F\amp T\amp T\\ F\amp F\amp F \end{array}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      So if you had breakfast and skipped lunch,
      you can look at the second row and see that the statement ``I will eat breakfast today or I will eat lunch today" is still true.
    </p>
